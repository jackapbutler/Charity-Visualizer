Displays data relating to Irish Charities and trends in charitable causes.
<br/><br/> 

Future To-Do:
1. Clean up website aesthetic.
2. Use [data.gov.ie](http://data.gov.ie/) for society wellbeing statistics, etc. Also [worldbank.com](http://worldbank.com/) and other websites. Display these using Plotly.
3. Display impact of donation in terms of calculating my impact such as “1 person off the streets”.
4. Include “AI-Powered High Impact Fund” based on criteria which uses machine learning to optimise portfolio. Which donates monthly to predicted causes and charities within those causes.
<br/><br/> 

Research how to identify important causes.
- Criteria can be % change over last X period (example increase in homelessness)
- Cost related values based on increases.
- Using auto-time series to predict which causes will increase the most.
<br/><br/> 

Research how to identify which charity. 
- Criteria can be % on budget on admin/overhead (maybe in Irish data)
- Cost effectiveness for each dollar (givewell)
- Financial/Other transparency metrics (charity navigator)
